# WSPR Multi Band
 ESPP32 Multi Band WSPR beacon
 This project is a continuation of my Practical Wireless articles where a step by step approach ended up with 
 a single band WSPR beacon running on an Espressif ESP32. This project takes the single band code and adds more to give a multiband beacon 
 with functions to have different frequencies before and after sunrise. The code has been running for over 2 
 months on my ESP32
