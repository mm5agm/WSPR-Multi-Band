# WSPR Multi Band
ESPP32 Multi Band WSPR beacon

The transistors are 2N2222 and the resistors are all 10k
This project is a continuation of my Practical Wireless articles where a step by step approach ended up with 
a single band WSPR beacon running on an Espressif ESP32. If you haven't used the Arduino IDE before it will be best 
to go to the other project, WSPR, and go through that first. This project takes the single band code and adds 
low pass filter switching and different frequencies before and after sunrise. The code has been running for 
a few months on my ESP32.
